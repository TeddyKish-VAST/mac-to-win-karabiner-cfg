# Mac-To-Windows-Karabiner-Configs

To apply these configs (that attempt to make your mac behave as much windows-like as possible),
Paste this file in your karabiner-elements configuration folder, usually at `~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json`.
Then, open `Karabiner Elements`, review each simple/complex modification and tweak it to your liking!
